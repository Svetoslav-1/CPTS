# Pre-Engagement

This section covers everything that happens **before** a penetration test begins — the contractual documents, scoping meetings, and agreements that define the legal and operational boundaries of the engagement.

## Hint

A penetration test requires a specific set of documents to be prepared — each one created at a different point in the engagement timeline (after initial contact, before/during meetings, etc.). Count how many distinct documents are listed and what each one's purpose is.
