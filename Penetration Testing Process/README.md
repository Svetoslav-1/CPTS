# Penetration Testing Process

**Difficulty:** Fundamental | **Sections:** 15 | **Cubes:** +10

## Description

This module covers the full penetration testing lifecycle, from initial client contact through final report delivery. It breaks down each phase in detail — Pre-Engagement, Information Gathering, Vulnerability Assessment, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, Lateral Movement, and Post-Engagement — with practical examples illustrating the role of a penetration tester. It also covers the contractual and legal side of engagements, including how to establish a proper scope of work with a client. Understanding this process end-to-end is foundational before touching any technical tooling.

## Key Topics & Skills

- Pre-engagement documentation (NDA, SoW, RoE, Scoping Questionnaire, etc.)
- Penetration testing phases and their objectives
- Information gathering techniques
- Vulnerability assessment and predictive analysis

## CPTS Exam Relevance

> Focus on memorising the **7 pre-engagement documents** and their correct timing (After / Before / During). Know the **three categories of evasive testing** and when each applies. For reporting, understand the lifecycle of a report from draft to final — the exam has questions on exact terminology. Compliance acronyms (e.g. payment card standards) are also tested.
